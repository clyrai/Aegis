# What makes Aegis different

1) Privacy you can actually ship
	- Epsilon targeting and validated accountants make DP practical, not academic.

2) Federation that survives the real world
	- Krum and Trimmed Mean reduce the impact of bad or noisy clients; straggler‑tolerant orchestration.

3) Security as a feature, not a checkbox
	- mTLS, RBAC, and tamper‑evident audit logs are on by default.

4) Compliance that speaks human
	- Reports are readable by risk and legal teams; mapped to GDPR/HIPAA/EU AI Act.

5) Time‑to‑value, measured in hours
	- Docker/K8s deploys, example models, and ready dashboards accelerate adoption.

Alternatives vs Aegis
- DIY DP/FL: flexible but slow to harden and operate.
- “Wrapper” tools: bolt DP/FL on top; limited trust and control.
- Aegis: designed end‑to‑end for privacy, federation, and operations.
